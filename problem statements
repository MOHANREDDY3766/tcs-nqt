It seems you're looking for the coding problem statements from the TCS National Qualifier Test (NQT). Here are a couple of examples of the types of problems that were given in the test:

1. **Chocolate Factory Problem**:
   - **Problem Statement**: A chocolate factory is packing chocolates into packets represented by an array of integers. The task is to find the empty packets (0) and push them to the end of the array.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: N=8 and arr = [4,5,0,1,9,0,5,0]
     - Output: [4,5,1,9,5,0,0,0]
# This line creates a list 'L' by mapping the 'int' function (which converts strings to integers)
# to each element in the list created by splitting the input string on spaces.
# The input is taken from the user and split into a list of strings, then each string is converted to an integer.
L = list(map(int, input('Enter the orders : ').split(' ')))

# An empty list 'L1' is created. This will be used to store the non-zero elements from 'L'.
L1 = []

# 'temp' is initialized to 0. It will count the number of zeros in 'L'.
temp = 0

# This 'for' loop iterates over each element in 'L'.
for i in L:
    # If the current element 'i' is not zero, it is appended to 'L1'.
    if i != 0:
        L1.append(i)
    # If 'i' is zero, 'temp' is incremented by 1.
    else:
        temp += 1

# After the loop, if 'temp' is not zero (meaning there were zeros in 'L'),
# this 'if' block will execute.
if temp != 0:
    # Another 'for' loop runs 'temp' times.
    for i in range(temp):
        # For each iteration, a zero is appended to 'L1'.
        L1.append(0)

# Finally, 'L1' is printed, which now contains all the non-zero elements from 'L',
# followed by all the zeros that were in 'L'.
print(L1)


2. **Digital Logic Problem**:
   - **Problem Statement**: Given a positive integer as input, convert it to binary, toggle all bits after the most significant bit including the most significant bit, and print the positive integer value after toggling.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: 10
     - Output: 5
     - **Explanation**: Binary of 10 is 1010. After toggling, it becomes 0101, which is 5 in decimal.
import math
n = int(input("enter the value :"))
k = (1 << (int(math.log2(n)) + 1)) -1
print(n^k)

3. **Counting Sundays Problem**:
   - **Problem Statement**: Given the start day of the month and the number of days in the month, count the number of Sundays that occur.
   - **Example**:
     - Input: Start day - Monday, Number of days - 13
     - Output: 2 Sundays

These problems test various skills like array manipulation, binary operations, and logical reasoning. If you need more details or help with solving these types of problems, feel free to ask!
