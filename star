Example - This current process is totally manual which takes a lot of time to complete and because it is manual leads to a lot of interventions and errors.

This is for explaining how you handled the situation with your approach to overcome the problem.

Example - After all the deep dives i analysed all the process and wrote a python script which automated the entire process in just 5 minutes.
